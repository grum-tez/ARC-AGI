Return a single code block with the language indicated as ascii. Start with the pattern I gave you and complete it


---

First, produce a single code block with the language indicated as ascii of the Correct Output. The output must fit in the provided Empty Output Grid.
Then reflect on that code block. Reason aloud. 
Write a short list of the ways that it does reflect how the example inputs led to the corresponding example outputs (if there are any such ways).
Next, write a short list of ways that it does not reflect how the example inputs led to the corresponding example outputs (if there are any such ways) 
Give a rating out of 10 as to how close you think you are to the right answer

Then make a second attempt, again produce a single code block with the language indicated as ascii as your response.

Then reflect on that code block. Reason aloud. 
Write a short list of the ways that it does reflect how the example inputs led to the corresponding example outputs (if there are any such ways).
Next, write a short list of ways that it does not reflect how the example inputs led to the corresponding example outputs (if there are any such ways)
Give a rating out of 10 as to how close you think you are to the right answer

Then make a final attempt, again produce a single code block with the language indicated as ascii as your response.

Then reflect on this final code block. Reason aloud. Consider how both how it does, and does not reflect how the example inputs led to their corresponding example outputs.

End with a rating out of 10 as to how close you think you are to the right answer
