# ascii pattern recreation challenge

all the following ascii grid patterns are visual artworks within rectangular grid canvases, and therefore  MUST BE viewed with a monospaced font. This allows for the patterns, and the transformations from inputs to outputs, to be understood

Rules govern the transformation of the input patterns into the output patterns. Your task is to understand these rules so that you can create a new output from a given challenge input.

## Pattern examples

## Training Inputs

### Input 1
```ascii
_______
| #  #|
|## ##|
|     |
| # ##|
|## # |
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

### Input 2
```ascii
_______
|*  * |
| *  *|
|     |
|*  * |
|**  *|
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
```

### Input 3
```ascii
_______
|XX  X|
|X  X |
|     |
|XX XX|
|X  X |
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
```

## Training Outputs

### Output 1
```ascii
____
|##|
|# |
‾‾‾‾
```

### Output 2
```ascii
____
|* |
|**|
‾‾‾‾
```

### Output 3
```ascii
____
| X|
|X |
‾‾‾‾
```

## Challenge

### Input
```ascii
_______
|&& & |
| &  &|
|     |
|&& &&|
| &  &|
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
```

### Challenge Output

Your response must be strictly within this canvas.
```ascii
____
|  |
|  |
‾‾‾‾
```


Produce a single code block with the language indicated as ascii as your response. Then reflect on that code block. Reason aloud. Consider how both how it does, and does not reflect the examples you were given. Then make a final attempt, again produce a single code block with the language indicated as ascii as your response.
