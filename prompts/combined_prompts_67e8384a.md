# Ascii Grid Art Transformation Challenge

all the following ascii grid patterns are visual artworks within rectangular grid canvases, and therefore  MUST BE viewed with a monospaced font. This allows for the patterns, and the transformations from inputs to outputs, to be understood

Rules govern the transformation of the input patterns into the output patterns. Your task is to understand these rules so that you can create a new output from a given challenge input.

## Training Inputs

### Input 1
```ascii
+---+
|&@%|
|@%&|
|@%%|
+---+
```

### Input 2
```ascii
+---+
|$*&|
|$$*|
|&@*|
+---+
```

### Input 3
```ascii
+---+
|#&#|
|#O%|
|###|
+---+
```

### Input 4
```ascii
+---+
|*#*|
|#X*|
|X*O|
+---+
```

## Training Outputs

### Output 1
```ascii
+------+
|&@%%@&|
|@%&&%@|
|@%%%%@|
|@%%%%@|
|@%&&%@|
|&@%%@&|
+------+
```

### Output 2
```ascii
+------+
|$*&&*$|
|$$**$$|
|&@**@&|
|&@**@&|
|$$**$$|
|$*&&*$|
+------+
```

### Output 3
```ascii
+------+
|#&##&#|
|#O%%O#|
|######|
|######|
|#O%%O#|
|#&##&#|
+------+
```

### Output 4
```ascii
+------+
|*#**#*|
|#X**X#|
|X*OO*X|
|X*OO*X|
|#X**X#|
|*#**#*|
+------+
```

## Challenge

### Input
```ascii
+---+
|*OO|
|&##|
|###|
+---+
```


Produce a single code block with the language indicated as ascii as your response.
Then "Zoom out" and take a holistic perspective. Consider all the inputs together, followed by all the outputs together. Reason aloud about the images and sub-images of the inputs and the rules that dictate their relationship to the images and sub-images of the outputs. Then think about each of the inputs and their corresponding output. Reason aloud. Be certain and confident. Now reflect on your earlier answer. Consider how both how it does, and does not reflect the examples you were given, and the relationship you have discovered. Make a final attempt in the form of a single code block with the language indicated as ascii.

Tip: Look for shapes and patterns formed by the characters within the 2D ascii images.
