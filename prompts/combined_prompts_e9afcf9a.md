# ascii pattern recreation challenge

all the following ascii grid patterns are visual artworks within rectangular grid canvases, and therefore  MUST BE viewed with a monospaced font. This allows for the patterns, and the transformations from inputs to outputs, to be understood

## Pattern examples

### Pattern example 1
#### Input
input canvas size: 2x6
```ascii
________
|@@@@@@|
|~~~~~~|
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾```

#### Output
output canvas size: 2x6
```ascii
________
|@~@~@~|
|~@~@~@|
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾```

### Pattern example 2
#### Input
input canvas size: 2x6
```ascii
________
|%%%%%%|
|XXXXXX|
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾```

#### Output
output canvas size: 2x6
```ascii
________
|%X%X%X|
|X%X%X%|
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾```

### Output
output canvas size: 2x6

## Challenge 1
### Input

Produce a single code block with the language indicated as ascii as your response. Then reflect on that code block. Reason aloud. Consider how both how it does, and does not reflect the examples you were given. Then make a final attempt, again produce a single code block with the language indicated as ascii as your response.
